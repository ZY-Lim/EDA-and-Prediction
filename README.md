# EDA-and-Prediction
ASA 2009 Statistical Computing and Graphics Data Expo Dataset
The dataset consist of flight arrival and departure details for all commercial flights on major carriers in USA, from Oct 1987 to April 2008.
Making use of the dataset in year 2006 and 2007, I will be finding out;
- when is the best time to minimise delay
- do older planes suffer more delays?
- how does number of people flying to different locations change over time
- detect cascading failures as delays in one airport creates delays in another
- construction a model that predicts delays

This will be done in both R and Python
